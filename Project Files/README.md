# 🌊 FloodCast – Flood Prediction and Risk Analysis  

## 📖 Overview  
FloodCast is a **data science project** that uses machine learning and interactive visualizations to **predict flood risks** and provide **actionable insights** for disaster preparedness and resource allocation.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Kaggle dataset acquisition and data cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover flood patterns and risk factors  
- Feature engineering and encoding to improve model performance  
- Multiple ML models trained and evaluated for prediction  
- Gradio-based user interface for easy flood forecasting  
- Power BI dashboard for in-depth visualization and decision support  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Gradio  
- **Visualization**: Power BI  
- **Dataset**: Kaggle flood prediction dataset  
- **Version Control**: GitHub  

---

## 📊 Workflow  
1. Data acquisition → Kaggle dataset  
2. Data cleaning → Missing values, outliers  
3. EDA → Trends, rainfall vs. flood correlation  
4. Feature engineering → Encoding and scaling  
5. Modeling → Training/testing multiple ML models  
6. Deployment → Gradio interface for predictions  
7. Visualization → Power BI dashboard for business insights  

---

## 💡 Business Value  
FloodCast goes beyond predictions to provide **resource allocation strategies**, **evacuation planning insights**, and **infrastructure prioritization** for flood-prone areas.  

---

## 🔮 Future Work  
- Integrate **real-time weather data** for live predictions  
- Deploy as a **cloud-based web app** for wider accessibility  
- Add **geospatial mapping** for region-specific risk visualization  
- Experiment with **deep learning models** for improved accuracy  
- Expand dashboards to include **early warning and resource planning simulations**
